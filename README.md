Installation and Usage
======================

 - A throwaway database account is provided. But, you can edit /config/config.js with your own credentials. A throwaway google API account is also provided, but you can edit config/auth.js with your own credentials. If you do either of these, make sure to run the "git --assume-unchanged" command (described below) to prevent your details from being uploaded. 
 - `npm install`
 - `node app.js`
 - You need to log-in with google in order to make any changes to the document. 

Setting up a Google API account 
==============================
If you look at /config/auth.js, you'll be able to find fill in your Google API credentials.
https://console.developers.google.com/project

Click on the "Apis & Auth > Credentials" tab.
This is what you want things to look like:

You'll also want to run the --assume-unchanged command on the config directory, so you don't push up your configuration details to github.
